  Our project is an interactive choose your own adventure game. It allows the 
  user to choose the character they would like to play the game as, and goes
  through a series of scenarios in which the user must choose what to do when 
  faced with different tasks including battling knights, casting spells, and 
  making decisions that affect Camelot.

  The game starts with a maze navigation game, and the user's score in that game 
  is used to determine which scenario the player starts with. As the user 
  continues through different scenarios of the game and chooses for themself how 
  to proceed, the user can either win the game by solving the final word 
  unscramble game correctly, saving Camelot, or lose the game by solving this 
  game incorrectly. Additionally, once a player's health score is 0 they lose 
  the game.
