  Our project is an interactive calculator. It supports standard mathematical
  operations like addition, multiplication, negation, and division on both
  integers and floating-point numbers. The interface is completely
  programmable--new functions can easily be defined and assigned to new "keys"
  in the visual interface.

  Standard visual I/O is supported, but the calculator can also emit sound. By
  pressing down a special key, it can play a fugue by J.S. Bach.
