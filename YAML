  Our project is an interactive choose your own adventure game. It allows the 
  user to choose the character they would like to play the game as, and goes
  through a series of scenarios in which the user must choose what to do when 
  faced with different tasks. 

  As the user continues through different scenarios of the game and chooses for 
  themself how to proceed, the user can either win the game by saving Camelot 
  or lose the game once their health becomes 0 points.
